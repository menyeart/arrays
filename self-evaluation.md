# Arrays
- I feel confident with the Arrays content so far, but I'm a little scared because I've seen some of this stuff before and worked through some of conditionals last night and I'm still behind as far as the mid point check in goes.
- I wouldnt' mind more practice or exposure to more array methods.
- I dont have any specific questions about the learning, but wouldn't mind seeing examples of how arrays might interact with other parts of code.
